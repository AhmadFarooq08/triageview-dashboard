### Risk Assessment Algorithm

TriageView uses a hierarchical 6-point risk scoring system:

1. **Level 6 - Critical Behavior**: Recent suicidal behavior (C-SSRS)
2. **Level 5 - Critical Ideation**: Active suicidal ideation with plan
3. **Level 4 - High Self-Harm**: PHQ-9 Q9 positive
4. **Level 3 - High Symptom**: Severe depression/anxiety/PTSD scores
5. **Level 2 - Medium Risk**: Moderate symptoms or compounding factors
6. **Level 1 - Low Risk**: Minimal symptoms

### Data Model

The system processes comprehensive veteran profiles including:

- **Demographics**: Age, gender, military branch, service era
- **Clinical Assessments**: PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5, C-SSRS scores
- **Risk Factors**: Housing, social support, substance use
- **Treatment History**: Previous care, assigned clinicians
- **Social Determinants**: Transportation, emergency contacts
